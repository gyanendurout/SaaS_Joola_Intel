## Outstanding Issues

| Issue | Severity | Detail |
|-------|----------|--------|
| yt_channel_weekly only 12 rows | Medium | Apify YT run returned 269 items but fix script only matched 1 channel — may need to re-run YT scrape or inspect run output format |
| Jay Devilliers 78 followers | Low | Handle `@jaydevilliers` likely wrong — verify correct IG handle |
| Bobbi Oshiro 5,753 vs DB 28,000 | Low | Handle may have changed or wrong account scraped |
| 15 influencers show 0 followers | Medium | Accounts not found — private/deactivated or wrong handles |
| ig_comments shows 1,000 in fix report vs 2,099 in count_rows | Low | Likely truncated in fix script report — count_rows is authoritative |
